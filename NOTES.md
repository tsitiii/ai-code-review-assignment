# Notes (Optional)

This file is optional.

Use it only if you want to provide **additional context** for the reviewer that does not fit cleanly in `submission_template.md`.

Examples of appropriate use:
- Assumptions you made
- Known limitations of your solution
- Alternative approaches you considered but did not implement

Do not repeat information already included in `submission_template.md`.

Remove the contents of this file and write your notes.
